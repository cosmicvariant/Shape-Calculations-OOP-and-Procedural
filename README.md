# Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of various shapes. Implement a Shape class
with subclasses for Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Use object oriented principles to model the shapes
and create methods to calculate their area and perimeter. Then, create a procedural part of the program
that takes user input to select a shape, input its dimensions, and displays the calculated area and
perimeter.
